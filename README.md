# I-Derma (A Svelete Website Project)

A landing page for a dermat clinic, completed in svelte using sveltekit v1.5. I chose svelte to better understand newer JS frameworks, and had previous experience in Angular. The learning curve was smooth and there were many helpful documentations to get started quickly. However the community is still small and I faced some challenges along the way. Nevertheless, this is a complete basic project with some hard-coding sprinkled in between. Do keep this in mind when cloning!
